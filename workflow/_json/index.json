If there’s room for human error, or a chance I’ll need it again later, I’d rather build it right the first time — even if that means diving into the rabbit hole. Hopefully, all the time I’ve spent trying to be lazy makes things a little easier for you, too.\n\n**Save Time**\n\n**Avoid Errors**\n\n**Create Flow**"

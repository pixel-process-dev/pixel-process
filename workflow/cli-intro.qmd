## Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking through menus, you type commands into a terminal to navigate directories, manage files, run programs, and more. While it may seem intimidating at first, the CLI is powerful for automation, customization, and efficiency.

### Why use CLI

- **Efficiency**: Perform tasks faster than through graphical interfaces.

- **Automation**: Combine commands into scripts for repeatable workflows.

- **Control**: Access deeper system functionality and options.

- **Remote Work**: SSH into servers and manage systems without a GUI.

Common CLIs include bash, zsh, and PowerShell. On macOS and Linux, bash or zsh are standard; on Windows, PowerShell is the default.

## The Shell

The shell is the program that interprets commands you type and executes them.

**Popular shells**:

- Bash: Common on Linux

- Zsh: Default on macOS

- PowerShell: Default on Windows

The shell supports built-in commands and lets you run programs, pipe outputs, and customize your environment.

## Aliases

An alias is a shortcut for commands.

Optimize your workflow by:

- Shortening commands

- Reduce errors from mistyping
- Customize common CLI commands

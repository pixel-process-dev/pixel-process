## Why Packaging Matters

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Reusability
<div class="tab-card static-tab">
- Packages allow developers to encapsulate functionality in reusable modules.
- Once packaged, code can be imported and used across multiple projects without rewriting.
- Example: A utility package for data manipulation can be reused in various data science projects.

</div>

## Maintainability
<div class="tab-card static-tab">
- By organizing code into packages, it's easier to manage, update, and fix bugs.
- Modifications in a well-structured package can be reflected in all projects that depend on it.
- Separate components of a large system can be independently maintained within packages.

</div>

## Collaboration
<div class="tab-card static-tab">
- Packages make it easier for teams to work together, as code is modular and shareable.
- Versioning ensures collaborators use consistent versions, minimizing conflicts.
- A package hosted on platforms like GitHub or PyPI enables wider access and contribution from others.

</div>

## Distribution
<div class="tab-card static-tab">
- Packaging allows easy distribution of software to users.
- Public repositories like PyPI enable anyone to install the package with a simple command (`pip install`).
- This accelerates adoption and makes libraries and tools available to the entire Python community.

</div>

## Encapsulation
<div class="tab-card static-tab">
- Packages encapsulate specific functionalities and keep project codebases clean and modular.
- Encapsulation helps with code separation and prevents functions from different areas from conflicting with each other.

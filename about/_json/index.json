      "markdown": "The pixel process is a powerful method for learning, and just in data and computer science.\n\nTo work effectively with image data, you need to understand what‚Äôs in a single pixel: its value range, color representation (grayscale, RGB, RGBA), and image grid. Understanding a pixel is easy, while understanding an image is much more difficult. Even the most advanced computer vision techniques rely on pixel level data.\n\nPixels may seem small and uninteresting, but they are the foundation for creating stunning visuals and impactful analytics."

A correlation coefficient of 1 means the two variables \ntrack perfectly in a positive direction. -1 represents two variables that are \ninversely related to each other (as one goes up the other goes down).\n\nUse the `cor` command on a data frame to get the correlations of all numeric columns\nin the data frame.\nNote: the diagnol should always be 1 as each variable should correlate perfectly with itself.\nNote: The data in the matrix is redundant. The top half and bottom half show the same\nrelationships.\n\nIt can be very helpful to visualize the correlations. Here we use the `corrplot` command\nfrom the corrplot package.\nTHe darker the color, the stronger the correlation. Red represents negative \ncorrelations while blue is used for positive correlations.\n\nTo get more details on a single correlation and to test it's significance, \nuse the `cor.test` command. \n\nThis shows a significant correlation (p value less than .05).\n\nLet's visualize the relationship!\n\n## t-tests\n\n### Single sample t-test\n\nFor a single sample t-test, a vector of numeric numbers is tested against a known value (mu).\nThe test determines if the vector differs from the set/known value.\n\nLet's take a look at the weight of the cars in the dataset with a histogram to begin.\n\nIt looks like the distribution centers around 3, so let's test the weights against the value of 3.\n\nHere, we see that the values do not differ from 3 (p-value greater than .05).\nThis makes sense since we chose a mu that based on the data.\n\nIn the real-world, this type of analysis may be useful to see if a sample differs\nfrom a known population value. For example, if the height residents of a country differ\nfrom the known global average. \n\n### Two samples independent t-test\nA two samples independent t-test is used to compare two vectors and see if they come\nfrom the same sample.\n\nFor this example, we will compare V-shaped engines with straight engines on mpg.\n\nHere we can see that the column `vs` has two levels, 0 and 1.\n\nLet's also find out how many of each type there are.\n\nThere are two ways to run the t-test. We can specify a numeric column and a binary\nidentifier column for groups or we can use two numeric vectors. \n\nBoth methods will be demonstrated here, although they should yeild identical results.\n\nWe see from the results, that there is a significant difference in mpg based on engine type.\nThe means at the bottom tell us the average for each type.\n\nNext, remember that you can subset data using a condition and column selection.\nWe will create two vectors, one for each engine type and re-run the analysis.\nThis is for demonstration purposes, you can choose either option and get the same results.\n\nNotice, the results are identical. This just demonstrates that the test can be run\nwith data in various formats.\n\nLet's visualize the results with a bar graph.\n\nAdd error bars to the plot!\nBegin by calculating mean and standard deviation.\n\nCreate the plot with the new dataset.\n\n### ChickWeight Data\n\nWe need another dataset to run a paired samples t-test. So we will load the\nChickWeight data set. We will start by examining the data and reshaping it.\nThen we will run a paired samples t-test.\n\nSee the help for definitions of each column.\n\nUse the summary function to get an idea of the data in each column.\n\nWe want to reshape the data so we can easily pull each day from its own column.\n\nWe use the `reshape` method to turn the data from long to wide format.\n\nMissing data will throw off the analysis, so we want to check for missing data.\n\nWe see that there are 22 missing data points. \n\nWe use the `complete.cases` function to drop rows with missing data.\n\nNote, we lost 5 rows of data due to missing data.\n\n### Paired Samples t-test\nWe can now compare the first and second time points.\n\nWe can plot the average weight at each point and see that, as we might expect, \nweight goes up at each subsequent timepoint.\n\nThis concludes the introduction to analysis in R!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document.

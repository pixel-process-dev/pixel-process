Machine learning isn’t magic — it’s a process. This section walks through the core workflow: exploring and shaping data, building and training models, and testing how well they perform. Expect practical tools, clear examples, and real evaluation — not black boxes or buzzwords.

**It’s not the model — it’s what you do with it.**

Don’t get stuck in a loop of adjusting sliders and chasing score decimals. Build projects. Focus on data (more data, cleaner data, feature engineering) for insight. Make something that solves a problem or tells a story.

## Machine Learning Topics

- **Explorator Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand data properties, data types, missing data, outliers, and more key factors to effective ML.
- **Classification**: Models that work on categorized predictions (spam/not-spam).
- **Regression**: Models that prediction continuous values (stock prices).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Determine how to evaluate a model and assess performance.

I used to run dozens of models, hyperparameter tuning, and comparitive metrics. While it taught me a lot, the biggest lesson was:

 Modeling is a tool, *meaning* is the goal.

**Understand data** — no good models are built on bad data

**Fit Models** — no good inference comes from inappropriate models

**Test Performance** — all models are poor until proven otherwise

Machine learning isn't magic, and it’s not about finding the model — it’s about applying the right tools to meaningful questions. The most advanced models require on proper input and programming.

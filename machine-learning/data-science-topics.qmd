## Data Science Applications

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.

### Classification

Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a discrete class label for a given input.

<!-- Unsupported type: category_grid -->

### Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous value for a given input.

### Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP involves the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

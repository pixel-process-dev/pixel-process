## Rethinking What We Know

Learning doesn‚Äôt happen all at once‚Äîit evolves. Concepts we once held as certain may shift with new context, experience, or tools. The point of learning isn‚Äôt to lock in static knowledge, but to stay open to rethinking and reworking. Like refactoring code, insight grows from iteration.

This space is for exactly that: ideas revisited, connections redrawn, and assumptions gently shaken. Sometimes playful, sometimes practical, always curious.

## And, Or, Not

Posts are organized by the **bitwise operators** you might recognize from programming‚Äîbut here they represent how ideas relate to one another:

- `&` **(AND)** ‚Äî Complementary or intersecting concepts  
  _Examples: Information: Continuous & Categorical_  
- `|` **(OR)** ‚Äî Contrasting or competing ideas  
  _Examples: Design: Structure | Spontaneity_  
- `~` **(NOT)** ‚Äî Reframed, nuanced, or subverted concepts  
  _Examples: Mistakes: Feature ~ Flaw_

### Essential Knowledge
<h3 id="Do I need to know statistics?" class="visually-hidden">Do I need to know statistics?</h3>
<details>
<summary class="faq-summary">Do I need to know statistics?</summary>

A basic understanding of stats helps you consume and create data responsibly. But you don’t need deep expertise to be effective.

</details>

<h3 id="I am not a numbers person, can I still code?" class="visually-hidden">I am not a numbers person, can I still code?</h3>
<details>
<summary class="faq-summary">I am not a numbers person, can I still code?</summary>

Yes. Coding is more about logic and patterns than complex math. Python especially is beginner-friendly.

</details>

<h3 id="How much math do I need to know?" class="visually-hidden">How much math do I need to know?</h3>
<details>
<summary class="faq-summary">How much math do I need to know?</summary>

Basic algebra, probability, and statistics are often enough. You’ll learn what you need along the way.

</details>

<h3 id="Do I need to memorize syntax?" class="visually-hidden">Do I need to memorize syntax?</h3>
<details>
<summary class="faq-summary">Do I need to memorize syntax?</summary>

No. Focus on understanding logic and patterns. You’ll look up syntax often — even professionals do.

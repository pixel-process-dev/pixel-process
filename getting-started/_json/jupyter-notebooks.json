Notebooks are ideal for EDA, tutorials, and teaching. By seperating code into cells and combining code, documentation, and visualizations notebooks allow for rapid iteration and interactive learning.\n\n[Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)"

This is particularly useful for data analysis and exploration.\n\n- **Documentation and Code Together**: You can include markdown cells for documentation alongside your code cells, making it easier to explain your thought process and findings.\n\n- **Visualization Integration**: Jupyter Notebooks support rich outputs such as charts and graphs, which can be rendered directly within the notebook.\n\n- **Reproducibility**: Notebooks can be shared easily, and others can rerun the code to reproduce the results, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in research."

The output of the code, such as results or visualizations, appears directly below the cell.\n\n- **Markdown Cells**: Used to write formatted text using Markdown syntax. These cells are perfect for adding explanations, headers, lists, links, and other documentation.\n\n- **Raw Cells**: Used to write plain text that is not processed by the notebook. These cells are rarely used and are generally for specific formats or custom content."

Press `Ctrl + Enter` to run the current cell and stay in the same cell.\n\n- **Toolbar Buttons**: Click the `Run` button in the toolbar to execute the selected cell.\n\nThe output of the code, whether it's text, tables, or visualizations, will be displayed directly below the cell."

Hereâ€™s how to work with kernels in Jupyter Notebooks:\n\n- **Starting a Kernel**: When you open a Jupyter Notebook, a kernel is automatically started. You can see the kernel status in the top-right corner of the notebook interface.\n\n- **Changing Kernels**: If you want to change the kernel (e.g., switch from Python 3 to another kernel), you can do so from the `Kernel` menu. Select `Change kernel` and choose the desired kernel from the list.\n\n- **Restarting a Kernel**: Sometimes you may need to restart the kernel, especially if it becomes unresponsive or if you want to clear all outputs and start fresh. You can restart the kernel from the `Kernel` menu by selecting `Restart`."

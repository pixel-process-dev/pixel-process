Tabular data, with information organized by rows and columns, provides that basis for many data analysis techniques and models. Usage includes financials, experimental data, and customer records often in the form of Excel sheets, csv files, and more.

Python has many utilities for working with tabular data including pandas and polars. Examples here will focus on pandas but similar considerations and tools exist in other packages for tabular data.

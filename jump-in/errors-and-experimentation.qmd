## Getting Started with Python

This guide introduces core Python concepts in a hands-on way, using **Jupyter notebooks** as the primary environment. You'll learn about variables, data types, basic syntax, error messages, and more. All in base Python, package use will come later.

::: {.callout icon="none" .custom-callout .pxp-ref title="Jupyter Notebooks"}

Notebooks are a great way to learn and collaborate with code. Be sure to check out [Jupyter Notebooks]({{{jupyter-noteobooks}}}) if you are unfamiliar with them, as they are heavily used in this project.

## Python Parts

Before jumping into the code, we'll cover the core pieces, pixels if you will, that Python is built upon. Many of these concepts are similar in other languages as well.

- **Datatypes**
- **Operators**
- **Reserved Words**
- **Builtin Functions**
- **Variables**
- **Flow Controls**

### Datatypes

Python uses datatypes to organize and process information. The datatype can determine how much data is stored, used, and displayed. Picking the right datatype for a use-case makes coding much smoother. Key catergories include numeric, strings, and sequences.

<div class="table-cheatsheet">
| Category | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Numbers | int | 42 |
| Numbers | float | 3.14 |
| Numbers | complex | 2 + 3j |
| Text | str | "hello" |
| Sequences | list | [1, 2, 3] |
| Sequences | tuple | (1, 2, 3) |
| Sequences | range | range(5) |
| Sets | set | {1, 2, 3} |
| Sets | frozenset | frozenset([1, 2, 3]) |
| Mappings | dict | {"a": 1, "b": 2} |
| Boolean | bool | True, False |
| Special | NoneType | None |

</div>


### Operators

Operations in programming are used to manipulate and evaluate values. These allow programs to perform calculations, make decisions, and control the flow of execution. 
Types include:

- **Mathematical**
- **Logical**
- **Comparison**
- **Assignment**


#### Mathematical

Mathematical operators perform arithmetic calculations. In Python, these include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `**` or `^` (exponentiation), and `%` or `%%` (modulus). Python uses `//` for integer division.

<div class="table-cheatsheet">
| Operator | Example | Meaning | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| + | 3 + 2 | Addition | 5 |
| - | 7 - 4 | Subtraction | 3 |
| * | 6 * 2 | Multiplication | 12 |
| / | 7 / 2 | Division (always float) | 3.5 |
| // | 7 // 2 | Floor (integer) division | 3 |
| % | 7 % 2 | Modulus (remainder) | 1 |
| ** | 2 ** 3 | Exponentiation | 8 |

</div>


#### Comparison

Comparison operators evaluate relationships between values. Common operators in Python include `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<` (less than), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>` (greater than), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).

These return boolean values of `True`/`False`.

<div class="table-cheatsheet">
| Operator | Example | Meaning | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| == | 3 == 3 | Equal to | True |
| != | 3 != 4 | Not equal to | True |
| > | 5 > 2 | Greater than | True |
| < | 2 < 5 | Less than | True |
| >= | 5 >= 5 | Greater than or equal to | True |
| <= | 4 <= 5 | Less than or equal to | True |

</div>


#### Logical

Logical operators allow for boolean logic. In Python: `and`, `or`, `not`. These are used in conditionals and loops to combine multiple logical expressions.

<div class="table-cheatsheet">
| Operator | Example | Meaning | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| and | (3 > 1) and (2 < 5) | True if both are true | True |
| or | (3 > 1) or (2 > 5) | True if at least one is true | True |
| not | not (3 > 1) | Negates (True → False) | False |

</div>


::: {.callout icon="none" .custom-callout .best-practice title="Assignment and Equality"}

Assignment uses `=` to assign a value to a variable. `x = 10` creates or updates the variable x to be 10.

Equality checking uses `==` and returns a Boolean (True, or False) depending on if the values are equal. `x == 10` will return True if x is set as above. 
:::


### Variables and Functions

Effective programming is built around reusable variables and code snippets like functions, classes, and methods. We'll explore this more in-depth throughout the project.

#### Variables

Variable assignment stores data in a named container. In Python, use `=` to assign values: `x = 5`. Variables are case-sensitive and can store numbers, strings, lists, and other datatypes. Variables in Python are **mutable** meaning the value can be modified.

<div class="table-cheatsheet">
| Example | Valid? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| age = 25 | ✅ Yes | Starts with a letter, letters only |
| user_name = "A" | ✅ Yes | Letters + underscore are allowed |
| temperature2 | ✅ Yes | Digits allowed, but not at start |
| _hidden | ✅ Yes | Leading underscore allowed (often used for “private” values) |
| MAX_VALUE | ✅ Yes | Uppercase is allowed, often used for constants |
| 2nd_value | ❌ No | Cannot start with a digit |
| user-name | ❌ No | Dash (-) not allowed |
| file.path | ❌ No | Dot (.) means “attribute,” not part of a name |
| my var | ❌ No | Spaces not allowed |
| return = 5 | ❌ No | return is a reserved Python keyword |

</div>


#### Functions

Functions create reusable code which can simplify tasks, allow iterative runs, and can make your code **much** more powerful. Python comes with some [builtin functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) which will help demonstrate. To begin, let's focus on:
- **`print`**: display the passed argument 
- **type**: returns the type of the passed argument
- **help**: returns documentation and help files of passed argument
- **Assignment**


<hr class="page-divider">

## Control Flow

Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic:

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Large")
elif x == 5:
    print("Exactly 5")
else:
    print("Small")
```

You’ll also see `for` and `while` loops, as well as function definitions like `def greet(name): ...`.

## Common Error Messages

You’ll encounter errors. That’s normal! Learn to read **tracebacks**.

- `SyntaxError`: Something’s wrong with your code structure.
- `NameError`: You used a variable that doesn’t exist.
- `TypeError`: You tried an operation on incompatible types.
- `IndentationError`: Your code blocks are not properly aligned.

## Combining Concepts

Try this small example to use variables, control flow, and output:

```python
score = 87
if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
else:
    grade = 'C or below'

print(f"Your grade: {grade}")
```
